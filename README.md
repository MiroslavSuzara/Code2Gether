# cs377uchat

Files adapted from: https://snack.expo.io/@bacon/firebase-basic-chat-video-tutorial and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo7xtBCh18o (Not using React Navigation 5). 


This is to demo that GiftedChat works with Firebase and React Navigation 5. User authentication is set to anonymous. 

## To run

In the terminal: 
```npm install```

```npm install --save firebase```

```firebase login```

```firebase init```
* Select database (Use an existing project -> cs377u-demo)

```firebase deploy```

Then start up the expo app:
```expo start```

If there's a pop up that warns the firebase you installed is the wrong version:
```expo install firebase```
